# audio_reality
Global Game Jam 2019 AR project

Just testing commits! <3 paul teehee

The root folder is the unity project folder. 
the scene we are working with is called "audio reality" in the editor, this is built off the example unity-ARkit project.
if you want to add stuff, please do it in the assets folder so unity can find it easily.
